# 2048.vim

This is a shameless clone of the 2048 game http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ except implemented in vimscript.

## Installation
You should be able to do the usual thing with vundle:
    Bundle 'AshyIsMe/2048'

## Usage
Start a new game with:
    :NewGame2048

This will open a new tab and start a new game.  
The controls are simply the cursor keys Up, Down, Left, Right.
